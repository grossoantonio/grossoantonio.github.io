With the experience gained over the years, to satisfy the ever-increasing requests for support from its customers and to expand its markets, the company has managed to develop by offering an increasingly complete service.

With the support of a well-stocked warehouse, it began marketing and distributing spare parts and accessories for tanneries of all kinds, mechanical and electrical parts, used and reconditioned machinery with guarantee.
