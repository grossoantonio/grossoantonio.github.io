        Our company has a wide range of rubber products used in the tanning industry. Each one of them has a different use.
        We use various types of rubber for flat presses that print the leather, both natural and synthetic, available in various compounds and lengths, for the different customer applications. We also have rubbers to make staking machines carpets and rubbers used in the pbuffing process, to clean the buffing paper, allowing then to use less sheets.
