Our company is able to provide photoengraved roller designs used for the finishing of the leather. These rollers are mounted on buffering machines to reproduce effects or drawings on the leather. The rollers are engraved with cutting edge, high precision machinery and this allows us to guarantee high product quality and new solutions to fully meet the production needs of our customers.
